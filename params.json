{"name":"HighQueue","tagline":"A Queue for High Performance message passing between threads, processes, or other components.","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n> IMPORTANT: This is beta. Please test it, but remember it is not ready for critical applications, yet.\r\n \r\nA High Performance Queue (HighQueue) is a mechanism for message passing between components of a system.  It is most often used to pass messages between two or more threads in the same process, but it can also be used for intra-process communication by putting the HighQueue in shared memory. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  The HighQueue Haiku\r\n\r\n  Sending messages\r\n  Quickly takes clean code and a\r\n  Good algorithm.\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Clients\r\nHighQueue clients can be either a Publisher or a Consumer.\r\n* Producers create and publish data into the HighQueue.   \r\n* Consumers accept and process data from the HighQueue.\r\nEach HighQueue instance supports multiple Producers, but only a single Consumer.\r\n\r\n##How fast is it?\r\nAbsolute performance numbers are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. The results vary widely from machine to machine.\r\n\r\nThat being said, tests on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @3.60GHz [8 cores] with one producer and one consumer\r\nshow sustained throughput is around 33 million messages/second.  This translates to around 30 nanoseconds per message delivery.  \r\n\r\nWith multiple producers the delivery rate slows to around 14M messages/second(70 nsec per delivery.) This result remains steady as additional producers are added as long as there are more cores than threads.  Once the number of threads reaches the number of cores performance becomes slower and more difficult to predict.\r\n\r\nIf HighQueue is used in a pipeline of six processing stages with minimal actual work in each stage, the entire pipeline can handle messages at the rate of 0.8M messages/second (120 nsec/message.)\r\n\r\nYou can generate equivalent numbers for your machine by running the MultiProducerPerformanceTest and PipelineTest which is included in the HQPerformance executable.\r\n\r\n<em>Your Mileage Will Vary!</em>\r\n\r\n##HighQueue depends on\r\n\r\n  * A modern C++ compiler that implements the C++11 standard.\r\n    * VisualStudio 12 (2013) works.\r\n    * gcc 4.7.2 works.\r\n  * OCI's Make Project Creator (MPC) V4.1 or later. (http://www.ociweb.com/products/mpc)\r\n    * MPC is used to create make files for gcc or Visual Studio [tm] solution and project files.\r\n  * Boost Test (any recent version) (http://www.boost.org/)\r\n    * Boost test is used for functional and performance testing. \r\n\r\nNeither MPC nor Boost is needed at runtime. \r\n\r\n##Licensing\r\nHighQueue is distributed with a very friendly, non-viral license.  You are required to include the HighQueue license including the appropriate disclaimers with any product that incorporates HighQueue.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
